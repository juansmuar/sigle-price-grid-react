## My process

### Built with

- HTML5

### What I learned

In this project we learn how to use React to make components.

```js
import './App.css';
import SinglePriceGrid from './components/SinglePriceGrid';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SinglePriceGrid/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```


### Continued development

We need to continue learning about how React works.

### Useful resources
